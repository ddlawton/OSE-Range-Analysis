## Overview

This site presents a reproducible analysis of the 2021 *Oedaleus senegalensis* (OSE) dataset, collected by Mamour and collaborators across four regions of Senegal: **Fatick, Kaffrine, Thiès, and Saint-Louis**. The study examined how fertilizer application influences grasshopper densities and millet yield, while also providing insights into OSE’s regional dynamics and distribution along a rainfall gradient.

The analyses and figures here build on previous work from our *Scientific Reports* paper, applying similar statistical frameworks to an expanded dataset that includes additional regions and survey rounds. All scripts, data processing, and visualizations are documented in this Quarto project for transparency and reproducibility.

## Study Background

During the 2021 growing season (July–October), 250 farmers participated in a paired-field experiment where each managed: - **One fertilized field**, receiving 150 kg each of NPK and urea. - **One non-fertilized control field**.

Each field was surveyed three times to record: - Grasshopper density and developmental stage\
- Vegetation cover and temperature\
- Millet yield at harvest

In total, the survey covered **500 ha across 1,500 observations**. The Saint-Louis region, which experienced extreme dryness that year, was only sampled twice due to field abandonment.

## Analytical Goals

We are exploring several complementary objectives:

1.  **Fertilization and Pest Pressure**\
    Quantify how fertilizer affects OSE density and yield using mixed-effects models, assessing whether improved plant vigor corresponds to lower infestation rates.

2.  **Regional Dynamics and Rainfall Gradients**\
    Evaluate OSE abundance in relation to mean annual rainfall and latitude, to infer how climatic gradients structure its range across Senegal.

3.  **Generational and Temporal Patterns**\
    Visualize the timing of OSE developmental stages across regions to assess whether northern populations are locally derived or the result of seasonal migrations.

## Visual and Analytical Outputs

-   [**Main Analysis**](analysis/main_analysis.qmd)**:** Statistical models of fertilizer effects on OSE density and yield\
<!-- -   [**Supplementary Analyses**](analysis/supplementary.qmd)**:** Extended model results and sensitivity checks\
-   [**Figures Gallery**](analysis/figures_gallery.qmd)**:** Key maps, rainfall gradients, and generation timing visuals -->

All figures are reproducible from R scripts stored in the `R/` folder and rendered through this Quarto project.
