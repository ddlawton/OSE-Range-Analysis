## Overview

This site presents a reproducible analysis of the 2021 *Oedaleus senegalensis* (OSE) dataset, collected by Mamour and collaborators across four regions of Senegal: Fatick, Kaffrine, Thiès, and Saint-Louis. The study examined how fertilizer application influences grasshopper densities and millet yield, while also providing insights into OSE’s regional dynamics and distribution along a rainfall gradient.

The analyses and figures here build on previous work from our *Scientific Reports* paper, applying similar statistical frameworks to an expanded dataset that includes additional regions and survey rounds. All scripts, data processing, and visualizations are documented in this Quarto project for transparency and reproducibility.

## Study Background

During the 2021 growing season (July–October), 250 farmers participated in a paired-field experiment where each managed: 
- One fertilized field receiving 150 kg each of NPK and urea. 
- One non-fertilized control field.

Each field was surveyed three times to record: - Grasshopper density and developmental stage\
- Vegetation cover and temperature\
- Millet yield at harvest

In total, the survey covered 500 ha across 1,500 sampling points. The Saint-Louis region, which experienced extreme dryness that year, was only sampled twice due to field abandonment.

## Analytical Goals

We are exploring several complementary objectives:

1.  [**Fertilization and Pest Pressure**](analysis/locust_denisty_analysis.qmd)**:**\
    Quantify how fertilizer affects OSE density using mixed-effects models, assessing whether improved plant vigor corresponds to lower infestation rates and look how OSE density is influenced by ground cover

2. **OSE density impacts on millet yield** (page TBA) \
    understand how millet yield is influence by OSE presence (and presumabley millet damage)

3.  **Regional Dynamics and Rainfall Gradients** (page TBA)\
    Evaluate OSE abundance in relation to mean annual rainfall and latitude, to infer how climatic gradients structure its range across Senegal.

4.  **Generational and Temporal Patterns** (page TBA)\
    Visualize the timing of OSE developmental stages across regions to assess whether northern populations are locally derived or the result of seasonal migrations.

## Visual and Analytical Outputs

All figures are reproducible from R scripts stored in the `R/` folder and rendered through this Quarto project.
