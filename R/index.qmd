## Overview

This site presents a reproducible analysis of the 2021 *Oedaleus senegalensis* (OSE) dataset, collected across four regions of Senegal: Fatick, Kaffrine, Thiès, and Saint-Louis. The study examined how fertilizer application influences grasshopper densities and millet yield, while also providing insights into OSE’s regional dynamics and distribution along a rainfall gradient.

The analyses and figures here build on previous work from our *Scientific Reports* paper, applying similar statistical frameworks to an expanded dataset that includes additional regions and survey rounds. All scripts, data processing, and visualizations are documented in this Quarto project for transparency and reproducibility.

## Study Background

During the 2021 growing season (July–October), 250 farmers participated in a paired-field experiment where each managed:

-   One fertilized field receiving 150 kg each of NPK and urea.

-   One non-fertilized control field.

Each field was surveyed three times to record:

-   Grasshopper density and developmental stage

-   Vegetation cover and temperature

-   Millet yield at harvest

In total, the survey covered 500 ha across 1,500 sampling points. The Saint-Louis region, which experienced extreme dryness that year, was only sampled twice due to field abandonment.

# Analytical Goals

Our analyses address several complementary objectives:

**Locust Dynamics**

This section presents results on locust density across treatments and regions, as well as relationships between locust abundance, plant cover, and temperature.

**Yield Impact**

Here, we examine how locust density influences yield, explore yield patterns across treatments and regions, and assess how temperature affects yield outcomes.

**Regional Dynamics and Rainfall Gradients (page TBA)**

This section will evaluate OSE abundance along gradients of mean annual rainfall and latitude to infer how climatic variation structures its range across Senegal.

**Generational and Temporal Patterns (page TBA)**

This section will visualize the timing of OSE developmental stages across regions to assess whether northern populations are locally derived or result from seasonal migration

## Visual and Analytical Outputs

All figures are reproducible from R scripts stored in the `R/` folder and rendered through this Quarto project.
