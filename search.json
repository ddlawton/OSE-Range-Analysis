    "text": "We would like to see how density is influenced by plant cover. To do this I am building a generalized additive model (family: tweedie). Following this form:\nThe generalized additive model (GAM) fitted is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{ose\\_count}_i = \\\\\n  &\\alpha + \\\\\n  &+ f(\\text{percent\\_ground\\_cover}_i,\\, \\text{region\\_treat}_i) +  \\\\\n  &+ b_{\\text{farmer}_i} + \\\\\n  &+ \\varepsilon_i\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nwhere:\nThe model diagnostics look pretty good! I tried to build a poisson model, but the data was overdispersed. Instead I went with a tweedie model which does a pretty good job at handling this type of data:\nHowever, I am not able to reproduce the smooths seen in the manuscript sent to me. This is likely due to data differences as I am not sure what was included in the initial modeling approach. Roughly we can see similiar trends in Kaffrine, Fatick, and Saint Louis. But Thies definitely has a different trend. Additionally, there seems to be different trends between control and fertilized treatments as comapred to the current plots in the manuscript. Not sure what to think here."

    "text": "Study Background\nDuring the 2021 growing season (July–October), 250 farmers participated in a paired-field experiment where each managed:\n\nOne fertilized field receiving 150 kg each of NPK and urea.\nOne non-fertilized control field.\n\nEach field was surveyed three times to record:\n\nGrasshopper density and developmental stage\nVegetation cover and temperature\nMillet yield at harvest\n\nIn total, the survey covered 500 ha across 1,500 sampling points. The Saint-Louis region, which experienced extreme dryness that year, was only sampled twice due to field abandonment."

    "text": "Goal\nThis should be a straight forward investigation as we are simply looking at how fertilization inlfluences millet yield. We should look at it by region to see any regional differences.\n\n\nRaw data visualization\nIt is fairly obvious that fertilization influences millet yield. It is interesting to see the regional differences. It appears that Thies has a much strong response to fertilization than farms at Fatick or Kaffrine. Or at least the variation is dramatically less.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModeling\nThis model formula will be similar to locust density by treatment x region. I will hold farmer as a random effect. So the model formula looks like this:\n\n\nCode\nformula &lt;- yield ~\n    fertilizer_treatment * region + # interactive fixed effect\n    (1|farmer) # random effect\n\n\nAs can be seen in the modeled results below, fertilization significantly improved yield across the board. For whatever reason, Thies had lower yield unfertilized but also saw the biggest incase in yield when fertilized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are the tabulated summaries for the model:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel estimates for yield ~ fertilizer x region model\n\n\nFixed effects and random parameter SDs\n\n\n\neffect\nComponent\nEstimate\nStd. error\nz\np_value\np-value\n\n\n\n\nRandom parameters\n\n\nsd__(Intercept)\nran_pars\ncond\n0.551\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\n\nFixed effects\n\n\nIntercept\nfixed\ncond\n5.957\n0.085\n70.410\n0.000\n&lt;0.001***\n\n\nFertilized\nfixed\ncond\n0.590\n0.053\n11.145\n0.000\n&lt;0.001***\n\n\nKaffrine\nfixed\ncond\n−0.001\n0.114\n−0.005\n0.996\n0.996\n\n\nThies\nfixed\ncond\n−0.266\n0.127\n−2.094\n0.036\n0.036*\n\n\nFertilized:Kaffrine\nfixed\ncond\n−0.008\n0.071\n−0.110\n0.912\n0.912\n\n\nFertilized:Thies\nfixed\ncond\n0.350\n0.081\n4.303\n0.000\n&lt;0.001***\n\n\n\nSignificance: *** p &lt; 0.001, ** p &lt; 0.01, * p &lt; 0.05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd of course the pairwise comparisons for fertilizer x region\n\n\nCode\n# Prepare and format p-value with significance stars\nemms_pw_prepped &lt;- emms$pairwise %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    p_label = case_when(\n      is.na(p.value)   ~ \"-\",\n      p.value == 0     ~ \"&lt;0.001***\",\n      p.value &lt; 0.001  ~ \"&lt;0.001***\",\n      p.value &lt; 0.01   ~ paste0(formatC(p.value, digits = 3, format = \"e\"), \"**\"),\n      p.value &lt; 0.05   ~ paste0(formatC(p.value, digits = 3, format = \"e\"), \"*\"),\n      TRUE             ~ formatC(p.value, digits = 3, format = \"e\")\n    )\n  )\n\n# Make column names readable\ncol_labels &lt;- c(\n  contrast   = \"Contrast\",\n  ratio      = \"Ratio\",\n  SE         = \"Std.
