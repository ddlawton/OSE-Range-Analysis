The Saint-Louis region, which experienced extreme dryness that year, was only sampled twice due to field abandonment."

    "text": "Analytical Goals\nWe are exploring several complementary objectives:\n\nFertilization and Pest Pressure:\nQuantify how fertilizer affects OSE density using mixed-effects models, assessing whether improved plant vigor corresponds to lower infestation rates and look how OSE density is influenced by ground cover\nOSE density impacts on millet yield (page TBA)\nunderstand how millet yield is influence by OSE presence (and presumabley millet damage)\nRegional Dynamics and Rainfall Gradients (page TBA)\nEvaluate OSE abundance in relation to mean annual rainfall and latitude, to infer how climatic gradients structure its range across Senegal.\nGenerational and Temporal Patterns (page TBA)\nVisualize the timing of OSE developmental stages across regions to assess whether northern populations are locally derived or the result of seasonal migrations."
